# TODO

- customize test integration dirs post-setup() (for machine-local config)
- Filter test panel by status
- action: jump to test

## Future

- More test integrations
- Run after build
- Test playlists
- Debug test integration
- Code coverage integration
- command to rerun failed tests (set limit on number of concurrent jobs)
- Panel for _file_ tests
- Document all properties of: integration, test result
- bug: Rerun via action menu in test panel clears diagnostics
- python unittest tests sometimes get stuck in running status
- Defines a (customizable) way to find a test file from a file (integrate with vim-projectionist?)
